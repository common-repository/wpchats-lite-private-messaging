You can use WpChats to build a simple chat system on your blog, to allow your users communicate with each other. You can also use it for support, to build an online support desk for your product, with a little minor tweaks and customization to fit this need.

In case of confusion, this plugin does not offer what you call Live Chat, which basically lets a random visitor start chat with an admin or moderator without login in. Instead, with WpChats, users must be registered and signed in in order to exchange messages, and then, all these messages will be saved in the database and accessible anytime in the user conversations pages.
